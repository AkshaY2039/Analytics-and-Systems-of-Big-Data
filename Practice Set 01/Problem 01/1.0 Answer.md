##	Definitions
*	Support  
	>	The support of a rule is the frequency of which the LHS and RHS appear together in the dataset. If X -> Y is a rule, then the support is P(Y and X).
*	Confidence  
	>	The confidence of a rule is the probability of the RHS given the LHS. If X -> Y, then the confidence is P(Y|X).
*	Lift
	>	The lift of a rule is the ratio of the observed support to the expected support if the LHS and RHS were independent.If X -> Y, then the lift is given by the fraction P(X and Y) / (P(X) * P(Y)). Lift may find very strong associations for less frequent items
*	Conviction
	>	The conviction of a rule X -> Y is the ratio P(not Y) / P(not Y | X). It's the proportion of how often Y does not appear in the data to how often Y does not appear in the data, given X. If the ratio is large, then the confidence is large and Y appears often.
*	Leverage
	>	Leverage of a rule X -> Y is the difference of the support of the rule and the expected support if the LHS and RHS were independent i.e. P(X -> Y)-(P(X) * P(Y)).
